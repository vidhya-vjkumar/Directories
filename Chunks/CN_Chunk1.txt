Computer Network
A set of devices (nodes) connected by a communication link (medium)
�A node can be a computer, printer or any other device capable of sending/receiving data
�A link can be a cable, air, optical fiber or any medium which can transport a signal carrying information
Computer network is an Interconnected collection of computers
�2 computers are interconnected if they are able to exchange information
�Purpose : For sharing data & resources
�Communication is the process of exchanging information between two persons or devices

Business Applications
- Resource sharing
- Information sharing

Home applications
- Person-to-person communication
- Access to remote information
- Interactive entertainment
- E-commerce

Mobile users (mobile with internet)

Advantages of Computer Networking
- It enhances communication and availability of information.
- It allows for more convenient resource sharing
- It makes file sharing easier
- It is highly flexible.
- Improved security
- Increased speed

Disadvantages of Computer Networking
- Privacy issues
- security difficulties
- Presence of computer viruses and malware
- Failure of server
- High cost of installation
- Proper & careful maintenanceSocial Issues
Introduction of networking has introduced new social, ethical and political problems.
- Newsgroups debate sensitive issues.
- Network operator risk being sued for contents.
- Right to free speech may be violated.
- Anonymous message can be desirable.

Network Topologies

�Network Topology is the pattern used to arrange the nodes of network (describe the way computers are connected).
�Basic topologies: bus, ring, star, mesh, hybrid

1. Bus Topology

oSimplest

odesigned in such a way that all the stations are connected through a single cable(known as a backbone cable)

oAdvantages: low cost cable, moderate data speed, limited failure

oDisadvantages : reconfiguration is difficult, signal interference, extensive cabling**Network Topologies**

1. **Bus Topology**

�A single cable connects all the devices in the network
�The cable is called the bus
�The bus is a shared medium
�All the devices on the bus can communicate with each other
�If one device is down, the entire network is down

2. **Ring Topology**

�All computers are connected in a closed loop
�Each node connects to exactly two other nodes, creating a circular network structure.
�One broken device can disable entire network

3. **Star Topology**

�All the devices are connected to a single hub
�This hub is the central node and all other nodes are connected to the central node
�Failure of central hub will make the entire network collapse
�Cost of installation is high4. Mesh Topology
� Computers are interconnected with each other
� There are multiple paths from one computer to another
� Internet is an example of mesh topology
� 2 types � fully connected and partially connected (certain computers are connected) mesh topology
5. Hybrid Topology
� Combination of various different topologies
� Two or more topologies are combined together
� Advantages: reliable, flexible, effective
� Disadvantages: complex design , costly infrastructure
