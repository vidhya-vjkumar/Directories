Layers can offer two different types of service to the layers above them:

* **Connection-oriented**
* **Connectionless**

1. **Connection-oriented service**

* This service follows a sequence of operations:
    * Establish a connection
    * Data transfer
    * Terminate the connection

* To talk to someone, you pick up the phone, dial the number, talk, and then hang up. Similarly, to use a connection-
oriented network service, the service user first establishes a connection, uses the connection, and then releases the
connection. In some cases when a connection is established, the sender, receiver conduct a negotiation about the
parameters to be used, such as maximum message size, quality of service required, and other issues. Typically, one side
makes a proposal and the other side can accept it, reject it, or make a counter-proposal.

* Here, data arrive in the order they were sent.
* This is a reliable service.

2. **Connectionless service**

* No connection Establishment
* Unreliable (meaning not acknowledged) connectionless service
* Does not return an acknowledgement to the sender.
* Normally, when two messages are sent to the same destination, the first one sent will be the first one to arrive.
However, it is possible that the first one sent can be delayed so that the second one arrives first.
* There is no guarantee.
* The order in which messages are sent and arrived can be different. � OSI Reference Model
