Reference Models (network architectures)

For More Study Materials: https://www.keralanotes.com/OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection
Designed by the International Standards Organization (ISO)
The model is called the ISO-OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Reference Model
(Because it deals with connecting open systemsï¿½that is, systems that are open for communication with other systems.)
It has seven layers: OSI Reference Model

The network layer is responsible for the source-to-destination delivery of a packet.

At this layer, the unit of data exchanged among nodes is typically called a packet.

Network layer ensures that each packet gets from its point of origin to its final destination.

Other responsibilities of the network layer includes routing and Logical addressing.

Logical addressing: The physical addressing implemented by the data link layer handles the addressing problem
locally. If a packet passes the network boundary, we need another addressing system to help distinguish the source
and destination systems. The network layer adds a header to the packet coming from the upper layer that, among
other things, includes the logical addresses of the sender and receiver.

Routing : When there are multiple paths between source and destination, only one route must be chosen.

4. Transport Layer

Here, the unit of data exchanged is TPDU.

The transport layer is responsible for process-to-process delivery of the entire message.

Other responsibilities:

* Connection control: The transport layer can be either connectionless or connection oriented. (A connection oriented
transport layer makes a connection with the transport layer at the destination machine first before delivering the
packets. After all the data are transferred, the connection is terminated.)
* Protocols used :TCP-Transmission control protocol (connection oriented)
UDP-user datagram protocol (connectionless)
* Segmentation and reassembly: A message is divided into transmittable se gments, with each segment containing a
sequence number. These numbers enable the transport layer to reassemble the message correctly upon arriving at the
destination and to identify and replace packets that were lost in transmission.
* Flow control
* Error control5. Session Layer

It establishes, maintains, and synchronizes the interaction among communicating systems.

Session layer is responsible for dialog control and synchronization.

Specific responsibilities of the session layer includes:

- Dialog control. The session layer allows two systems to enter into a dialog. It allows the communication
between two processes to take place in either half duplex (one way at a time) or full-duplex (two ways at a
time) mode.

- Synchronization. The session layer allows a proc ess to add checkpoints(inspect any packet), or
synchronization points, to a stream of data.

6. Presentation Layer

presentation layer is concerned with the syntax and semantics of the information exchanged between two
systems .

Specific responsibilities of the presentation layer includes: the

- Translation (exchanging information the form of character strings, numbers, and so on. The
presentation layer at the sender changes the info rmation from its sender-dependent format into a
common format. The presentation layer at the receiving machine changes the common format into its
receiver-dependent format )

- Encryption : (ensure privacy) (sender transforms the original information to another form and sends
the resulting message out over the network. Decryption reverses the original process to transform the
message back to its original form)

- compression :Data compression reduces the number of bits contained in the information. Data
compression becomes particularly important in the transmission of multimedia such as text, audio, and
video**Application Layer**

* Provide services to users
* application layer enables the user, whether human or software, to access the network. It provides user
interfaces and support for services such as electronic mail, remote file access and transfer, shared
database management, and other types of distributed information services.
* Specific services provided:
    * File transfer, access, and management : This application allows a user to access files (to make changes or
read data), to retrieve files , and to manage or control files.
    * Mail services: This application provides the basis for e-mail forwarding and storage
    * Directory services : This application provides distributed database sources and access for global
information about various objects and services.
* Protocols used : FTP , SMTP , HTTP etc1. Host-to-Network Layer

* host-to-network layer is equivalent to the combination of the physical and data link layers
* The TCP/IP reference model does not really say much about what happens here, except to point out that the host
has to connect to the network using some protocol so it can send IP packets to it. This protocol is not defined and
varies from host to host and network to network.
