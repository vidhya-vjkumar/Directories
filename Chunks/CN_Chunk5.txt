* The 4 layers of TCP/Model are: host-to-network, internet, transport, and application layer

2. Internet Layer

* Internet layer defines an official packet format and protocol called IP (Internet Protocol).
* The internet layer is equivalent to the network layer.
* The job of the internet layer is to deliver IP packets where they are supposed to go.
* Packet routing & avoiding congestion are the major issue here.
* For these reasons, it is reasonable to say that the TCP/IP internet layer is similar in functionality to the OSI
network layer
* uses four supporting protocols:
ARP - Address Resolution Protocol
RARP -Reverse Address Resolution Protocol
ICMP -Internet Control Message Protocol
IGMP -Internet Group Message Protocol3. Transport Layer 
�UDP and TCP are transport level protocols responsible for delivery of a message from a process (running
program) to another process.
oTCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
oUDP (User Datagram Protocol) 
�A new transport layer protocol, SCTP , has been devised to meet the needs of some newer applications.
oStream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
4. Application Layer
�Provide services to users
�contains all the higher-level protocols like
file transfer (FTP)
electronic mail (SMTP)
Domain Name System (DNS)
Terminal network (TELNET)
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)Protocols and networks in the TCP/IP model

OSI MODEL TCP/IP MODEL

Contains 7 layers Contains 4 layers

Considered a theoretical model Considered more reliable

It distinguishes between service,
interface and protocol Does not clearly distinguish between
service, interface and protocol

Model was developed before the
development of protocols Protocols were developed first & then
the model was developed

Protocol independent standard Protocol dependent standard

More complexity due to more number of
