    * **RSUB:** To return**SIC/XE Architecture**

1. **Instruction Set**

* 16-bit instruction format
* 2-part op-code
* 4 addressing modes
* Conditional branch instructions
* 5 types of instructions:
    * Data transfer
    * Arithmetic
    * Logical
    * Program control
    * Input/Output

2. **Memory**

* 16-bit memory address
* Maximum memory size of 64K bytes
* 16-bit words stored in memory
* Memory mapped I/O

3. **Registers**

* 4 general-purpose registers: A, X, L, and S
* 1 accumulator register (A)
* 1 program counter (PC)
* 1 instruction register (IR)
* 1 condition code register (CC)

4. **Arithmetic and Logical Operations**

* Arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
* Logical operations: AND, OR, XOR, and NOT

5. **Program Control Instructions**

* Conditional branch instructions:
    * BEQ: Branch if equal
    * BNE: Branch if not equal
    * BLT: Branch if less than
    * BGT: Branch if greater than
* Unconditional branch instructions:
    * BRA: Branch always
    * RET: Return from subroutine

6. **Input and Output Instructions**

* I/O operations are executed by transferring a single byte each time.
* Target port is specified by last 8 bits of register A.
* Each device is assigned a unique 8 bit code to send and receive data and
control signals.

7. **Input and Output**

* Performed by transferring 1 byte at a time to or from right most 8 bits of
register A (Accumulator).
* Test Device (TD) instruction tests whether the addressed device is ready to
send and receive a byte of data.
* Read Data (RD) and Write Data (WD) is used for reading and writing of
data.

8. **Data Movement and Storage Definitions**

* LDA, STA, LDX, STX all uses 3 byte word.
* LDCH, STCH are associated with characters which uses 1 byte.
* Storage definitions are:
    * WORD - ONE WORD CONSTANT
    * RESW- ONE WORD VARIABLE
    * BYTE- ONE BYTE CONSTANT
    * RESB- ONE BYTE VARIABLE
