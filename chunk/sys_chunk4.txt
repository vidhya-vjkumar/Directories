Linker 

* Process of collecting and combining various pieces of code and data into single file that 
can be loaded into memory and executed.  
* Linking performed at compile time, when source code is translated to machine code, at 
load time, when program is loaded into memory and executed by loader and at run time 
by application programs. 

Types: 

a) Linking Loader: Performs all linking and relocation operations directly into main memory 
for execution. 

b) Linkage Editor: Produces a linked version of program called as load module or executable 
image. This load module is written into file or library for later execution.

c) Dynamic Linker: This linking postpones the linking function until execution time. Also 
called as dynamic loading. 
 
Loader 
 Utility of an operating system. 
 Copies program from a storage device to computer’s main memory.  
 They can replace virtual address with real address. 
 They are invisible to user. 
 
Debugger 
 An Interactive debugging system provides programmers with facilities that aid in testing 
and debugging of programs.  
 Debugging means locating bugs or faults in program. 
 Helps in fixing error. 
 Determination of exact nature and location of error in the program.
