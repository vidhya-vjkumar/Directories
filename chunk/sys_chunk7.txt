1. SIC/XE Instructions:

i. Instructions those perform Arithmetic operation on Memory
a. LDB- Load the register ‘B’ with some value.
Eg: LDBx- Load value of x in to register B.
b. STB- Store the register ‘B’ content in to some variable.
Eg: STBx- Store register ‘B’ content in to variable x.
ii. Instructions those perform floating point Arithmetic operation
a. ADDF
b. SUBF
c. MULF
d. DIVF
Here F is the floating point register
Eg: ADDF, here register ‘B’ contents are added with Accumulator content
and result is left with accumulator.
iii. Instruction that take operand from Register
RMO-Register move
Eg: RMO S,B Reg ister ‘S’ content is moved to ‘B’ register.
iv. Instruction which perform register arithmetic operation
a. ADDR
b. SUBR
c. MULTR
d. DIVR
Eg: ADDR S,B
add value of register B with register Sand store result in register B.

7. Input and Output:

The SIC/XE supports all the I/O instructions in the standard version.
There are special I/O channels which are utilized for data transfer when CPU
is involved in another process at same time.
Channels control associated I/O channels.
There can be maximum of 16 I/O channels each supporting maximum of 16
devices.16

 Data movement instructions are used to transfer data from one location to another location in memory. 
1. Move instruction 
MOVE M,R1 
R1 contains the address of the data. M contains the data. 
2. Load instruction 
LDB 5,R1 
R1 contains the address of the data. 5 contains the data. 
3. Store instruction 
STB R1,5 
R1 contains the address of the data. 5 contains the data. 
4. Transfer instruction 
LDA 5,R1 
R1 contains the address of the data. 5 contains the address of the data. 
5. Exchange instruction 
XCH R1,R2 
R1 and R2 contains the address of the data.
